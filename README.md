# Vulcan Swap -- client

This is the repo containing Vulcan Swap's React + Drizzle frontend.

You're probably going to want to spin up this client alongside a locally deployed blockchain, unless you only want to interact with the already-deployed Rinkeby contract.

## Deploy all of Vulcan Swap locally

Follow the instructions in the `vulcanswap-truffle` repo for the full setup pipeline: https://github.com/SeanJCasey/vulcanswap-truffle

## Deploy Vulcan Swap client only

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies
`git clone git@github.com:SeanJCasey/vulcanswap-client.git && cd vulcanswap-client && npm i`

2. Start the npm server
`npm start`
